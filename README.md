# fastai-learning-projects

This repo consolidates my learning of the powerful fastai library. currently on part 1 of the course where there are 8 different lessons.
https://course.fast.ai/

For each lesson, i run code in my own notebook and experiment with different things using the fastai methods taught. 

Course syllabus:
1: Getting started
2: Deployment
3: Neural net foundations
4: Natural Language (NLP)
5: From-scratch model
6: Random forests
7: Collaborative filtering
8: Convolutions (CNNs)

If there's time, one should also go through the actual book available on github: https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/01_intro.ipynb
